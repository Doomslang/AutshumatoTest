The '''Gateway Protection Programme''' is a scheme operated by the British government in partnership with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) and co-funded by the [[European Union]] (EU), offering a legal route for a quota of UNHCR-identified [[refugee]]s to settle in the United Kingdom. Following a proposal by the British Home Secretary, [[David Blunkett]], in October 2001, the legal basis was established by the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] and the programme itself launched in March 2004. Since its inception, the programme has enjoyed broad support from the UK's main political parties.

The Gateway Protection Programme initially had a quota of 500 refugees per year, which was later increased to 750, but the actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. [[Demographics of Liberia|Liberian]], [[Demographics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]], [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudanese]], [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]], [[Demographics of Mauritania|Mauritanian]], [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi]], [[Bhutanese refugees|Bhutanese]], [[Eritrean people|Eritrean]], [[Palestinians|Palestinian]], [[Demographics of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leonean]] and [[Somalis|Somali]] refugees have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 [[local authorities]] participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the [[North West England|North West region of England]] and three in [[Yorkshire and Humberside]]. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.

== Programme details ==
The programme is the UK's "quota refugee" [[Refugee resettlement|resettlement scheme]].{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009|p=1}} Refugees designated as particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are assessed by the [[Home Office]] for eligibility under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]. If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted [[indefinite leave to remain]].<ref name="Guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/assets/0002/5053/Gateway_good_practice_guide_sept_2008.pdf|title=Gateway Protection Programme: Good Practice Guide|year=2008|publisher=Refugee Council and Refugee Action|page=8}}</ref> The [[International Organization for Migration]] helps facilitate pre-departure [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]], [[counselling]], dossier preparation, [[transport]] and immediate arrival assistance.<ref name="IOM">{{cite web|url=http://unitedkingdom.iom.int/resettlement-and-family-reunification|title=Resettlement and Family Reunification|publisher=International Organization for Migration United Kingdom|accessdate=3 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031173903/http://unitedkingdom.iom.int/resettlement-and-family-reunification|archive-date=31 October 2014}}</ref> Once in the UK, refugees are entered into a 12-month support programme intended to aid their [[Social integration|integration]].{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009|p=1}} The programme has involved [[local authorities]] and [[NGO]]s{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009|p=1}} including the [[British Red Cross]], the [[International Rescue Committee]], [[Migrant Helpline]], [[Refugee Action]], the [[Refugee Arrivals Project]], the [[Refugee Council]], [[Scottish Refugee Council]] and [[Refugee Support]].{{sfn|Refugee Council|October 2004|p=1}}<ref name="Rutter">{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Jill|author2=with Cooley, Laurence; Reynolds, Sile; and Sheldon, Ruth|title=From Refugee to Citizen: 'Standing On My Own Two Feet'&nbsp;– A Research Report on Integration, 'Britishness' and Citizenship|publisher=Refugee Support|location=London|date=October 2007|page=24|url=https://www.metropolitan.org.uk/images/From-Refugee-to-Citizen-Exec.pdf}}</ref> These organisations formed the Resettlement Inter-Agency Partnership at the planning stage of the programme, in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees.{{sfn|Refugee Council|October 2004|p=1}}

Furthermore, he argues that the "hospitality" of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of "compassionate repression", with the UNHCR, the Home Office and local authorities all involved in "sorting, decision, and consideration over which individuals are the 'exceptional cases'", to the exclusion of others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Becoming bare life: asylum, hospitality, and the politics of encampment|first=Jonathan|last=Darling|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=2009|volume=27|issue=4|pages=649–665|doi=10.1068/d10307}}</ref>

== Evaluations ==
Resettlement has been presented as a means of the UK fulfilling its obligations towards displaced people in the context of hostile public attitudes towards asylum seekers.{{sfn|Cooley|Rutter|2007}} Research has shown that members of the British public are generally well disposed to providing protection to genuine refugees, but are sceptical about the validity of asylum seekers' claims.<ref name="Lewis">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Miranda|title=Asylum: Understanding Public Attitudes|publisher=Institute for Public Policy Research|location=London|year=2005|isbn=1-86030-273-4}}</ref> A report published in 2005 states that "some participating agencies have been reluctant to pursue a proactive media strategy due to local political considerations and issues relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers".{{sfn|Wright IV|Peach|Ward|2005|p=41}} However, in February 2006, the [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]] [[Andy Burnham]], when asked about how the programme fitted in with [[community cohesion]] strategies, stated in the House of Commons that:

<blockquote>
"The early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in the programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of the attacks on the notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years. In Bolton and Sheffield in particular, the towns have rallied around the individuals who have come to them. The programme has been a positive experience for the receiving community and, of course, for the vulnerable individuals who have benefited from the protection that those towns have offered".<ref name=Burnham>{{cite hansard|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-06.htm|title=Gateway Protection Programme|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|date=13 February 2006|column=1136}}</ref>
</blockquote>

A report into the experience of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the [[University of Sussex]] in December 2007. The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and [[English language]] skills.<ref name="Collyer">{{cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=080225-gppreport-web.pdf&site=252|title='On that day I am born...': The experience of refugees resettled to Brighton and Hove under the Gateway Protection Programme October 2006 to October 2007|last=Collyer|first=Michael|author2=de Guerre, Katie|date=December 2007|publisher=Sussex Centre for Migration Research, University of Sussex}}</ref> Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.{{sfn|Platts-Fowler|Robinson|2011|p=15}}

In February 2009, the Home Office published a report evaluating the effectiveness of the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement.{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009}} The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through [[community group]]s and [[Place of worship|places of worship]]. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress.{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009|p=19}} No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]] (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the [[International Catholic Migration Commission]] (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resettlement.eu/sites/icmc.tttp.eu/files/ICMC_WelcomeToSheffield.pdf|title=Welcome to Sheffield: Reflections on 8 years experience of receiving resettled refugees at the local level|publisher=Sheffield City Council and International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe|page=19}}</ref> – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013.{{sfn|Sim|Laughlin|2014|p=10}} The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.{{sfn|Sim|Laughlin|2014|p=2}}

A number of programme evaluations have found that many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment.{{sfn|Evans|Murray|2009|p=iii}} An evaluation undertaken by academics at [[Sheffield Hallam University]] for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who had been in the UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good.{{sfn|Platts-Fowler|Robinson|2011|p=20}} Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.{{sfn|Sim|Laughlin|2014|p=40}}
