'''''Thunderbirds''''' is a British science-fiction television series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], filmed by their production company [[AP Films]] (APF) and distributed by [[ITC Entertainment]]. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a combination of [[marionette]] puppetry and [[scale-model]] special effects sequences&nbsp;– a hybrid filming technique known as "[[Supermarionation]]". Two series comprising a total of 32 episodes were filmed; production ceased after the Andersons' financial backer, [[Lew Grade]], failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television.

Set in the mid-2060s, ''Thunderbirds'' is a follow-up to ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]''. It concerns the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically advanced land, sea, air and space rescue vehicles; these are headed by a fleet of five [[Thunderbirds machines|''Thunderbird'' machines]] and launched from [[Tracy Island]], a secret base in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The main characters are ex-astronaut [[Jeff Tracy]], the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the ''Thunderbird'' machines.

''Thunderbirds'' began its first UK run on the [[ITV network]] in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries.<ref name="Mitchell"/> Periodically repeated, the series was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes (including [[Thunderbirds 2086|a Japanese remake]]) and other media. As well as inspiring [[Thunderbirds merchandise|various merchandising campaigns]], it has been followed by two film sequels, [[Thunderbirds (film)|a live-action film adaptation]] and a mimed stage show tribute. A real-life rescue service, the [[International Rescue Corps]], is named after the organisation featured in the series.

Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442090/|title=''Thunderbirds'' (1965–66)|author=Clark, Anthony|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London, UK|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140530232412/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442090|archivedate=30 May 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="Taylor and Trim, 71"/> ''Thunderbirds'' has been praised for its effects (directed by [[Derek Meddings]]) and musical score (composed by [[Barry Gray]]).<ref name="Sangster and Condon"/><ref name="Thomas, 24"/> The series is well remembered for its [[title sequence]], which opens with an often-quoted countdown by voice actor [[Peter Dyneley]]: "5, 4, 3, 2, 1: ''Thunderbirds'' Are Go!"<ref name="O'Brien, 83"/><ref name="Knowles"/> A [[computer-animated]] remake, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', premiered on ITV in April 2015.<ref name="TBAG Premiere"/>

==Storyline==
{{Main|List of Thunderbirds episodes}}
Set between 2065 and 2067,<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;42 and 95.</ref> ''Thunderbirds'' follows the exploits of the Tracy family, headed by American ex-astronaut turned multi-millionaire philanthropist [[Jeff Tracy]]. He is a widower with five adult sons: [[Scott Tracy|Scott]], [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John]], [[Virgil Tracy|Virgil]], [[Gordon Tracy|Gordon]] and [[Alan Tracy|Alan]].<ref group="Note">Listed by age, in descending order, as stated in Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;53–57. According to Marriott 1993, pp.&nbsp;116–117, Virgil is the second-oldest son and John the third-oldest.</ref> The Tracys form International Rescue (IR), a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life. They are aided in this mission by technologically advanced land, sea, air and space vehicles, which are called into service when conventional rescue techniques prove ineffective. The most important of these are five machines named the "''Thunderbirds''", each assigned to one of the five Tracy brothers:

*''[[Thunderbird 1]]'': a [[hypersonic]] rocket plane used for fast response and accident zone reconnaissance. Piloted by primary rescue co-ordinator Scott Tracy.
*''[[Thunderbird 2]]'': a [[supersonic]] carrier aircraft that transports [[Thunderbird 2 pod vehicles|rescue vehicles and equipment]] to accident zones in detachable capsules known as "Pods". Piloted by Virgil.
*''[[Thunderbird 3]]'': a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] spacecraft. Piloted alternately by Alan and John, with Scott as co-pilot.
*''[[Thunderbird 4]]'': a utility [[submersible]]. Piloted by Gordon and normally launched from ''Thunderbird 2''.
*''[[Thunderbird 5]]'': a [[space station]] that relays distress calls from around the world. Manned alternately by "Space Monitors" John and Alan.<ref>Bentley 2005: vehicle descriptions, pp.&nbsp;45–49.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bleathman, Graham|title=Thunderbirds FAB Cross-Sections: Exposing the Secrets of the Craft, Machinery and Headquarters of International Rescue|year=2000|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-84222-091-7|page=19}}</ref>

Despite its humanitarian principles, some of IR's operations are necessitated not by misadventure but deliberate sabotage motivated by greed for power and wealth. For missions that require criminal investigation, the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by English aristocrat [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]] and her butler [[Aloysius Parker]]. Based at [[Creighton-Ward Mansion]] in Kent, Penelope and Parker's primary mode of transport is [[FAB 1]], a specially-modified [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]]. The most persistent of IR's adversaries is the criminal known only as the "[[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]]".<ref group="Note" name="Names"/><ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;61.</ref> Operating from a temple in the Malaysian jungle, and possessing abilities of hypnosis and [[dark magic]], he exerts a powerful telepathic control over Kyrano, his estranged half-brother, and manipulates the Tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs.

==Production==
{{Quote box|quote=I started to think that there really ought to be dumps around the world with rescue gear standing by, so that when a disaster happened, all these items of rescue equipment could be rushed to the disaster zone and used to help to get people out of trouble&nbsp;... I was thinking, 'Rescue, yes, rescue, but how to make it science fiction? What about an international rescue organisation?|source=&mdash;&nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] on the premise<ref name="Bentley, 8-9">Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;8–9.</ref>|align=right|salign=right|width=30%}}

''Thunderbirds'' was the fourth Supermarionation puppet TV series to be produced by APF, which was founded by the husband-and-wife duo of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson with their business partners [[Reg Hill]] and [[John Read (producer)|John Read]]. Pitched in late 1963, the series was commissioned by Lew Grade of ITC, APF's parent company, on the back of the positive audience response to ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]''.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/><ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;103.</ref>

Gerry Anderson drew inspiration for the series' underlying concept from the [[West German]] mining disaster known as the ''[[Wunder von Lengede]]'' ("Miracle of Lengede"). In October 1963, the collapse of a nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of [[Lengede]], killing 29 miners and trapping 21 others underground.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;6–7.</ref> Lacking the means to drill an escape shaft, the authorities were forced to requisition a heavy-duty bore from [[Bremen]]; the considerable time necessary to ship this device by rail had significantly reduced the chances of a successful rescue.<ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;8.</ref> Recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response, Anderson conceived the idea of an "international rescue" organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances.<ref name="Bentley, 8-9"/>

Seeking to distinguish his 26-episode proposal from APF's earlier productions, Anderson attempted to pitch stories at a level that would appeal to both adults and children. Whereas previous series had been shown during the late afternoon, Anderson wanted ''Thunderbirds'' to be broadcast in a family-friendly [[primetime]] slot.<ref name="Bentley, 12">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> Sylvia remembers that "our market had grown and a 'kidult' show&nbsp;... was the next step."<ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> The Andersons retired to their holiday villa in Portugal to expand the premise, script the pilot episode and compose a [[Bible (writing)|scriptwriters' guide]].<ref name="Bentley, 12"/><ref name="La Rivière, 106"/> According to Sylvia, the writing process depended on a "division of labour", whereby Gerry created the action sequences while she managed [[characterisation]].<ref name="La Rivière, 106">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> The decision to make a father and his sons the main characters was influenced by the premise of ''[[Bonanza]]'', as well as Sylvia's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series' appeal.<ref name="Anderson, 31">Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;31.</ref><ref name="Cull: Media, 202">Cull 2006 (August), p.&nbsp;202.</ref> The Tracy brothers were named after [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts: [[Scott Carpenter]], [[John Glenn]], [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], [[Gordon Cooper]] and [[Alan Shepard]].<ref name="BentleyCharacterBiographies"/>

The series' title was derived from a letter written by Gerry's brother, Lionel, while he had been serving overseas as an [[RAF]] flight sergeant during [[World War II]].<ref name="Bentley, 13">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;13.</ref> While stationed in Arizona, Lionel had made reference to [[Thunderbird Field No. 1|Thunderbird Field]], a nearby [[United States Army Air Forces]] base.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/><ref name="La Rivière, 111">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;111.</ref> Drawn to the "punchiness" of "''Thunderbirds''", Anderson dropped his [[working title]] of "''International Rescue''" and renamed both the series and IR's rescue vehicles, which had previously been designated ''Rescues 1'' to ''5''.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/> His inspiration for the launch sequences of ''Thunderbirds 1'', ''2'' and ''3'' originated from contemporary [[United States Air Force]] launch procedure: Anderson had learnt how the [[Strategic Air Command]] would keep its pilots on permanent standby, seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take-off at a moment's notice.<ref name="Cull: Media, 198">Cull 2006 (August), p.&nbsp;198.</ref>

In the DVD documentary ''The Thunderbirds Companion'', Anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused ''Thunderbirds'' to be made "as an American show".<ref name="MakingSecrets">{{Cite AV media|people=Meyers, Simon; Middleton, Guy (producers)|year=2000|title=Thunderbirds: The Making of the Secrets|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Carlton Communications|Carlton International Media]]|location=London, UK|asin=B0002475OI|time=05:22–06:22}}</ref> During the character development and voice casting process, the Andersons' main priority was to ensure that the series had [[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]] appeal, thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer.<ref name="Bentley, 12"/><ref name="Bignell, 81">Bignell, p.&nbsp;81.</ref> Scripts were typed in American English and printed on US-style [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|quarto-size]] paper.<ref>O'Brien, p.&nbsp;82.</ref>

===Filming===
''Thunderbirds'' was filmed at APF's studios on the [[Slough Trading Estate]] between 1964 and 1966.<ref name="Bentley, 22">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;22.</ref> In preparation, the number of full-time crew was expanded to 100.<ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;120.</ref> Shooting began in September 1964 after five months of pre-production.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/><ref name="Bentley, 16">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Due to the new series' technical complexity, this was a period longer than for any of APF's earlier productions.<ref>La Rivière, pp.&nbsp;110–111.</ref> To speed up the filming, episodes were shot in pairs, at a rate of one per month, on separate [[soundstage]]s and by separate crews (designated "A" and "B").<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;23 and 36.</ref> By 1964, APF was the UK's largest commercial user of colour film, consuming more than three million feet (570&nbsp;miles or 910&nbsp;kilometres) of stock per year.<ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>

Alan Pattillo, a veteran scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official [[script editor]] in late 1964.<ref name="Bentley, 24">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;24.</ref> This move was aimed to reduce the burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself.<ref name="Bentley, 25"/><ref>Cull 2006 (August), p.&nbsp;196.</ref> Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: Pattillo and [[David Elliott (director)|David Elliott]] alternated with the less experienced [[Desmond Saunders]] and newcomer [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] for each month's filming.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref name="La Rivière, 122">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;122.</ref> Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage<ref name="La Rivière, 123">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;123.</ref> In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that ''Thunderbirds'' contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;121.</ref> He explained that rapid editing was necessary on account of the characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest for more than a few seconds per shot.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/>

{{Quote box|quote=Lew watched ["Trapped in the Sky"] and at the end he jumped up shouting, 'Fantastic, absolutely fantastic! This isn't a television series – this is a feature film!

After viewing the completed 25-minute pilot, "[[Trapped in the Sky]]",<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/><ref name="Bentley, 26"/> Lew Grade was so impressed by APF's work that he instructed Anderson to double the episode length and increased the series' budget per episode from £25,000 to £38,000 (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|25000|1964|r=-3|fmt=c}} and £{{Inflation|UK|38000|1964|r=-3|fmt=c}} today).<ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/><ref name="Bentley, 26"/> As a result, ''Thunderbirds'' became not only the company's longest and highest-budgeted production, but also among the most expensive TV series to have been made up to that point.<ref name="Bentley, 26">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;26.</ref><ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> The crew, who had been filming at a rate of two 25-minute episodes per fortnight, faced significant challenges during the transition to the new format: eight episodes had already been completed,<ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;87.</ref> scripts for up to ten more had been written,<ref name="Bentley, 26"/> and substantial rewrites would be necessary to satisfy the longer running time.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;23 and 27.</ref> Anderson lamented: "Our time-scale was far too drawn out.

Everything had to move at twice the speed."<ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;122.</ref> APF spent over seven months extending the existing episodes.<ref name="Bentley, 28">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;28.</ref>

[[Tony Barwick]], who had impressed Pattillo and the Andersons with an unsubmitted script that he had written for ''[[Danger Man]]'', was recruited to assist in the writing of subplots and [[Padding|filler]] material.<ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;121.</ref><ref>Anderson 1991, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> He found that the longer format created opportunities to strengthen the characterisation.<ref name="Bentley, 26"/><ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;153.</ref> Science-fiction writer [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] suggests that "small character touches" make the puppet cast of ''Thunderbirds'' "much more rounded" than those of earlier APF series.<ref name="Peel, 14">Peel, p.&nbsp;14.</ref> He compares the writing favourably to that of live-action drama.<ref name="Peel, 14"/> The new footage proved useful during the development of the first series finale, "Security Hazard": since the previous two episodes had overspent their budgets, Pattillo devised a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-dominated [[clip show]] containing only 17 minutes of new material to reduce costs.<ref name="Bentley, 31">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;31.</ref><ref name="La Rivière, 128"/>

Filming of Series One was completed in December 1965.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/> A second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in March 1966.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;31 and 36.</ref> Barwick became a full-time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing Pattillo.<ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;264.</ref><ref name="La Rivière, 141">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;141.</ref> The main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt;<ref name="Marriott, 187">Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;187.</ref> in addition, the [[art department]] expanded some of the standing sets, including the Tracy Villa lounge and the ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'' control room.<ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;103.</ref> To accommodate the simultaneous filming of the TV series and ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', APF purchased two more buildings on the Slough Trading Estate and converted them into new stages.<ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;136.</ref><ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;113.</ref> As crew and studio space were divided between the two productions, filming of the TV series progressed at half the previous speed, as APF's B crew produced one episode per month.<ref name="Bentley, 36">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> Filming on ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' was completed by June, allowing A crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode, "Ricochet".<ref name="Bentley, 36"/>

Production of ''Thunderbirds'' ended in August 1966 with the completion of the sixth episode of Series Two.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/><ref name="Bentley, 37">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;37.</ref> In February that year, it had been reported that Grade had been unable to sell the series in the United States due to disagreements over timeslots.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;142.</ref><ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;145.</ref> In July, he [[Cancellation (television)|cancelled]] ''Thunderbirds'' after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer.<ref name="La Rivière, 141"/><ref name="Bentley, 37"/> The three major US networks of the time&nbsp;– [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]&nbsp;– had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price.

By the time of its cancellation, ''Thunderbirds'' had become widely popular in the UK and was being distributed extensively overseas.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 125"/><ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;202.</ref> Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs.<ref name="La Rivière, 141"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142"/> He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market.<ref name="La Rivière, 141"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142"/> This became ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 37"/>

British actor [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]] was among the first to be cast.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;17–18.</ref> He had previously voiced characters in ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''Stingray''.<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> Beyond the APF productions, he had supplied one of the original [[Dalek]] voices on ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> Cast alongside Graham was Australian actor [[Ray Barrett]].<ref name="Bentley, 17"/> Like Graham, he had worked for the Andersons before, having voiced Titan and Commander Shore in ''Stingray''.<ref name="La Rivière, 116">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;116.</ref> A veteran of radio drama, Barrett was skilled at performing a range of voices and accents in quick succession.<ref name="Bentley, 17"/> [[Villains of the week]] would typically be voiced by either Barrett or Graham.<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> Aware of the sensitive political climate of the [[Cold War]] and not wishing to "perpetuate the idea that Russia was the enemy with a whole generation of children watching",<ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;94.</ref> Gerry Anderson decided the Hood (voiced by Barrett) should be Oriental and placed his temple hideout in Malaysia to defy the viewer's expectations.<ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/><ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;117.</ref>

Although Lady Penelope and Parker (the latter voiced by Graham) were among the first characters developed, neither was conceived as a major role.<ref name="Anderson, 30">Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;30.</ref><ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 92">Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;92.</ref> Parker's [[Cockney]] manner was based on a waiter at a pub in [[Cookham]] that was sometimes visited by the crew.<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 92"/> On Gerry Anderson's recommendation, Graham dined there regularly to study the accent.<ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;122.</ref> Anderson's first choice for the role of Penelope had been [[Fenella Fielding]], but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself.<ref name="Bentley, 18"/><ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;91.</ref> Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and [[Joan Greenwood]].<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> On Penelope and Parker's secondary role as [[comic relief]], Gerry explained, "We British can laugh at ourselves, so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team. And in America they love the British aristocracy too.'"<ref name="Bignell, 81"/>

As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the recurring character of Commander Norman, chief of air traffic control at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen.<ref name="La Rivière, 117"/> [[Shane Rimmer]], the voice of Scott, was cast on the strength of his performance on the BBC soap opera ''[[Compact (TV series)|Compact]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 17"/> Meanwhile, fellow Canadian [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]] was selected at a late stage in the process.<ref name="La Rivière, 117"/> The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother. David, who [was] a bit older than I am, told them that he had this friend, me, who would be great."<ref name="Bentley, 19">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;19.</ref>

[[Christine Finn]], known for her role in the TV serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', provided the voices of Tin-Tin Kyrano and [[Grandma Tracy]].<ref name="Bentley, 18"/> With Sylvia Anderson, she was also responsible for voicing most of the female and child supporting characters. Other minor parts were voiced by [[Charles Tingwell]], [[Paul Maxwell]] and John Tate (the father of [[Nick Tate]]), who were not credited for their contributions.<ref name="Bentley, 19"/><ref>Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;351.</ref>

===Design and effects===
The puppet stages used for the filming of ''Thunderbirds'' were only one-fifth the size of those used for a standard live-action production, typically measuring {{Convert|12|by|14|by|3|m}} in length, width and height.<ref name="Marriott, 162">Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;162.</ref><ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;75.</ref> Bob Bell, assisted by [[Keith Wilson (production designer)|Keith Wilson]] and Grenville Nott, headed the art department for Series One.<ref name="La Rivière, 114">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;114.</ref> During the simultaneous filming of Series Two and ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' in 1966, Bell attended mainly to the film, entrusting [[set design]] for the TV series to Wilson.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;35–36.</ref>

Since it was necessary for the art department's interior sets to conform to the effects department's exterior plans, each team closely monitored the other's work.<ref name="Anderson, 67">Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> According to Sylvia Anderson, Bell's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department's push for "more extravagant" design.<ref name="Anderson, 67"/> This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets: Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their over-sized heads and hands.<ref name="Bentley, 14">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;14.</ref> He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem: "As soon as we positioned [the puppets] standing alongside [the model], they looked ridiculous, as the car towered over them."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;111.</ref> He ultimately adopted a "mix-and-match" approach, in which smaller items, such as tableware, were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies.<ref name="Bentley, 14"/>

While designing the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell and his staff strove for authenticity, ordering miniature [[Tudor period|Tudor]] paintings, {{Frac|1|3}}-scale [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]- and [[Regency architecture|Regency]]-style furniture and carpeting in the shape of a polar bear skin.<ref name="Bentley, 14"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/> This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops.<ref name="La Rivière, 114"/> For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;41.</ref>

====Puppets====
The head puppet sculptor was [[Christine Glanville]], who also served as the lead puppeteer.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref name="La Rivière, 115">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;115.</ref> Glanville's four-person team built the 13 members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between £250 and £300 per puppet (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|250|1964|fmt=c}} and £{{Inflation|UK|300|1964|fmt=c}} today).<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/><ref name="Bentley, 15">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> Since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages, the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate.<ref name="Bentley, 23">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;23.</ref> Facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads: as well as a head with a neutral expression, each main character was given a "smiler", a "frowner" and a "blinker".<ref name="Bentley, 16"/><ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;92.</ref> The finished puppets were approximately {{Convert|22|in|cm}} tall, or {{Frac|1|3}} adult human height.<ref name="Marriott, 162"/><ref name="Peel, 18">Peel, p.&nbsp;18.</ref>

The puppets were made up of more than 30 individual components, the most important of which was the [[solenoid]] that synchronised lip movements with the characters' pre-recorded dialogue.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;72.</ref> This device was positioned inside the head unit; consequently, torsos and limbs appeared relatively small.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/> The puppets' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown, who preferred the ''Thunderbirds'' marionettes over the accurately-proportioned ones that first appeared in ''Captain Scarlet'': "The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them&nbsp;... Even some of the more normal-looking faces, such as Scott and Jeff, for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards."<ref name="Bentley, 15"/> Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets' still being "very much caricatures", since it made them "more lovable and appealing&nbsp;... There was a naive quality about them and nothing too complex."<ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>

The appearances of the main characters were inspired by those of actors and other entertainers, who were typically selected from the show business directory ''[[Spotlight (directory)|Spotlight]]''.<ref name="Bentley, 15"/> According to Glanville, as part of a trend away from the strong caricature of previous series, APF was seeking "more natural faces" for the puppets.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/> The face of Jeff Tracy was based on that of [[Lorne Greene]],<ref name="Cull: Media, 202"/><ref name="Bentley, 16"/> Scott on [[Sean Connery]],<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/><ref name="Bentley, 15"/> Alan on [[Robert Reed]],<ref name="Bentley, 16"/> John on [[Adam Faith]] and [[Charlton Heston]],<ref name="Peel, 19">Peel, p.&nbsp;19.</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rhema.co.nz/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6975:thunderbirds-are-go-%E2%80%93-again|title=''Thunderbirds'' Are Go – Again!|date=5 February 2013|author=Anderson, Anne|work=rhema.co.nz|publisher=[[Rhema Broadcasting Group]]|location=[[Auckland]], New Zealand|accessdate=14 October 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223058/http://www.rhema.co.nz/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6975:thunderbirds-are-go-%E2%80%93-again|archivedate=19 October 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Brains on [[Anthony Perkins]]<ref name="La Rivière, 115"/> and Parker on [[Ben Warriss]].<ref name="Bentley, 16"/><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;49.</ref> Sylvia Anderson brought the character of Penelope to life in likeness as well as voice: after her test moulds were rejected, sculptor Mary Turner decided to use Anderson herself as a template.<ref>La Rivière, pp.&nbsp;108–109.</ref>

Main character heads were initially sculpted in either [[Plasticine]] or clay.

Wigs were made of [[mohair]] or, in the case of the Penelope puppet, human hair.<ref name="Bentley, 16"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 115">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;115.</ref> Puppet bodies were built in three sizes: "large male" (specifically for the Tracys and the Hood), "small male" and "small female".<ref name="Bentley, 16"/><ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> Sylvia Anderson, the head costume designer, devised the main characters' attire.<ref name="La Rivière, 106"/><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> To give the puppets increased mobility, the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials, instead working with cotton, silk and wool.<ref name="Bentley, 16"/> Between 1964 and 1966, the department's stock numbered more than 700 costumes.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;88.</ref>

Each puppet's head was fitted with about 10 thin [[tungsten steel]] wires.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 115"/><ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;99.</ref> During the filming, dialogue was played into the studio using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses.<ref name="Bentley, 20"/> Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process.<ref name="Bentley, 20"/> The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility,<ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;114.</ref> were made even less noticeable through the application of powder paint that matched the background colours of the set.<ref name="Bentley, 23"/> Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: "[The puppeteers] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [paint] here, anti-[[Lens flare|flare]] there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'"<ref name="La Rivière, 123"/> Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements with the help of a [[viewfinder]]-powered [[CCTV]] feedback system.<ref name="Bentley, 22"/> As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor [[Rod puppet|using rods]].<ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;124.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;41.</ref>

{{Quote box|quote=Since we always tried to minimise walking, we'd show the puppets taking one step only, then promptly cut.

Due to their low weight and the fact that they had only one control wire per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes involving movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a "bobbing" action to simulate motion.<ref name="La Rivière, 128">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;128.</ref><ref name="Peel, 19"/> Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'', director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)."<ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.<ref name="Peel, 20">Peel, p.&nbsp;20.</ref>

====Special effects====
The effects for all the APF series from ''Supercar'' to ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' were directed by [[Derek Meddings]], who later worked on the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' and ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]'' films.<ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;21.</ref> Knowing that ''Thunderbirds'' would be the "biggest project [APF] had worked on", Meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for ''Stingray''.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;104.</ref> He therefore established a second unit under technician [[Brian Johncock]], and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences.<ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28">Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;24 and 28.</ref> This expansion increased the number of APF crews and stages to five each.<ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28"/> A typical episode contained around 100 effects shots;<ref name="Bignell, 76">Bignell, p.&nbsp;76.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;40.</ref> Meddings' team completed up to 18 per day.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;63.</ref>

An addition to the effects department was [[Mike Trim]], who served as Meddings' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings.<ref name="Bentley, 24"/><ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;60.</ref> Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an "organic" design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children's toys.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;59.</ref><ref>Taylor and Trim, p.&nbsp;15.</ref> Models and sets were also "dirtied down" with powder paint or [[pencil lead]] to create a used look.<ref name="Andersonic9">{{Cite journal|date=Spring 2010|title=Interview: Mike Trim – Designs on the Future|journal=Andersonic|volume=1|issue=9|pages=4–12|editor=Farrell, Richard}}</ref><ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;22.</ref> Toy cars and vans were used in [[long shot]], while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] for added realism.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;57.</ref><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;107.</ref> Miniature fans and [[Jetex]] pellets, which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust, were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails.<ref name="Bentley, 25">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;25.</ref><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107"/> Another of Meddings' inventions was a closed, cyclical effects stage nicknamed the "rolling road": consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds, this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;21–22.</ref><ref>Bignell, p.&nbsp;79.</ref> Airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a "rolling sky", with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds.<ref name="Bentley, 22"/>

One of Meddings' first tasks was to shoot [[stock footage]] of the ''Thunderbird'' machines and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion.<ref name="Bentley, 21">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;21.</ref><ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;24.</ref> The finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the [[Stourhead|Stourhead Estate]] in Wiltshire.<ref name="La Rivière, 113">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;113.</ref> In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as [[associate producer]], Meddings was further tasked with designing the ''Thunderbird'' fleet and FAB 1.<ref name="Bentley, 12"/> Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/><ref name="Taylor and Trim, 12">Taylor and Trim, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the ''Thunderbird'' machines were created for the series.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;42.</ref>

During the designing and filming process, Meddings' first priorities were realism and credibility.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;44.</ref> With the exception of ''Thunderbird 5'', each vehicle was built in three or four scales.<ref>Archer, p.&nbsp;93.</ref> Meddings' [[swing-wing]] concept for ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'' was inspired by his wish to create something "more dynamic" than a fixed-wing aircraft.<ref name="Meddings, 45">Meddings, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'' until he inverted the wings, later commenting, "... at the time, all aircraft had swept-back wings.

The largest model of ''[[Thunderbird 3]]'', whose design was based on the Soviet ''[[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]]'' rocket, was {{Convert|6|ft|spell=in}} tall.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/> ''[[Thunderbird 4]]'' was particularly difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> ''Thunderbird 5'', the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, was based on the Tracy Island Round House.<ref name="Bentley, 14"/> Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed.<ref>Meddings, p.&nbsp;58.</ref> Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from balsa wood, [[Jelutong]] wood or fibreglass.<ref>Meddings, pp.&nbsp;52 and 54.</ref> To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.<ref name="Bentley, 13"/><ref name="Andersonic9"/>

As the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker needed to fit inside, the largest of all the models was the seven-foot FAB 1, which cost £2,500 (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|2500|1964|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to build.<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;13–14.</ref> The Rolls-Royce's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson.<ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;65.</ref> [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce Ltd.]] supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic [[radiator grille]] for close-up shots of the front of the car.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106"/><ref>La Rivière, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> In exchange for its cooperation, the company requested that a [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as "Rolls".<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;106.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;66.</ref>

By 1966, Meddings' commitments were split between Series Two and ''Thunderbirds Are Go''.<ref name="Bentley, 31"/> While Meddings worked on the film, camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects.<ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> By this stage, the basic frame of ''Thunderbird 2'' had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch.<ref name="La Rivière, 132">La Rivière, p.&nbsp;132.</ref> Meddings was displeased with the result, reflecting that the replacement was "not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape&nbsp;... I never felt our model-makers managed to recapture the look of the original."<ref name="La Rivière, 132"/>

Critic David Garland suggests that the challenge facing the ''Thunderbirds'' effects department was to strike a balance between the "conventional science-fiction imperative of the 'futuristic'" and the "seeping hyper-realist concerns mandated by the Andersons' approach to the puppets".<ref>Garland, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> ''Thunderbirds'' has been praised for the quality of its effects.

====Title sequence====
[[File:Gerry Anderson.jpg|thumb|alt=Gerry Anderson|Series co-creator [[Gerry Anderson]] storyboarded the ''Thunderbirds'' [[title sequence]].]]

The series' [[title sequence]], storyboarded by Gerry Anderson, is made up of two parts. It opens with a countdown of "5, 4, 3, 2, 1: ''Thunderbirds'' Are Go!", provided by Dyneley in character as Jeff Tracy.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/> In a departure from the style of ''Stingray'', the ''Thunderbirds'' title sequence varies with each episode: the first part consists of an action montage that serves as a preview of the plot.

In his foreword to John Marriott's book, ''Thunderbirds Are Go!'', Anderson put forward several explanations for the series' enduring popularity: it "contains elements that appeal to most children&nbsp;– danger, jeopardy and destruction.

[[Jeff Evans]], author of ''The Penguin TV Companion'', argues that the series' 50-minute format allows for stronger character development and "tension-building".<ref name="Evans"/> O'Brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing, asserting that the plots are often "formulaic" and are sometimes "stretched to snapping point" by the extended running time.<ref name="O'Brien, 83"/> Cornell, Day and Topping are critical: they consider the writing at times "woefully poor" and argue that ''Thunderbirds'' as a whole is "often as clichéd as previous Anderson series".<ref name="Cornell, Day and Topping"/> Peel, despite praising the storylines and characterisation, suggests that the "tongue-in-cheek" humour of ''Stingray'' is less evident.<ref>Peel, pp.&nbsp;240–248.</ref> Where ''Thunderbirds'' improves on its predecessor, Peel believes, is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices, child and animal characters, comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the "standard Anderson sexism": female characters, marginalised in earlier series, are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles.<ref>Peel, pp.&nbsp;242–243.</ref>

Noting the attention to detail of the series' launch sequences, Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the ''Thunderbird'' craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast.<ref name="Bignell, 78"/> The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian [[Nicholas J. Cull]], who comments that of all the Andersons' series, ''Thunderbirds'' is the most evocative of a recurring theme: the "necessity of the human component of the machine", whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by "brave human beings and technology working together".<ref>Cull 2006 (August), pp.&nbsp;197–198.</ref><ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6">Cull 2009, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> This makes the series' vision of the 2060s "wonderfully [[humanistic]] and reassuring".<ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/> O'Brien similarly praises this optimism, comparing the Tracy family to guardian [[Übermensch]].<ref name="O'Brien, 83"/> Writing for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired UK]]'' magazine, [[Warren Ellis]] asserts that the series' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of "mad and frightening engineers", adding that ''Thunderbirds'' "trades in vast, demented concepts&nbsp;... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/10/start/thunderbirds-will-grow-a-generation-of-mad-engineers|title=''Thunderbirds'' will Grow a Generation of Mad Engineers|author=[[Warren Ellis|Ellis, Warren]]|journal=[[Wired UK]]|date=2 September 2009|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City, New York|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130121153514/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/10/start/thunderbirds-will-grow-a-generation-of-mad-engineers|archivedate=21 January 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Thomas argues that the world of ''Thunderbirds'' is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary [[capitalism]] and [[class structure]]s appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths.<ref name="Thomas, 24">Thomas, p.&nbsp;24.</ref> According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series' lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines.<ref name="Thomas, 22"/> Newman, for his part, suggests that "the point isn't realism. The 21st century of ''Thunderbirds'' is detailed&nbsp;... but also de-populated, a high-tech toyland".<ref name="Newman"/> He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the "square, almost 50s" attitudes to race, gender and class.<ref name="Newman"/> With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he "would be happier if [villains] didn't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation".<ref name="Hood"/> Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects negative [[stereotyping]] through the use of "positive non-white characters" such as Kyrano and Tin-Tin.<ref name="Cull: Media, 197">Cull 2006 (August), p.&nbsp;197.</ref> However, he deems many of the one-off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as "corrupt businessmen, [[spiv]]s and gangsters familiar from crime films".<ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/>

Various commentators&nbsp;– including Bignell, Cull and O'Brien – have also discussed ''Thunderbirds'' as a product of the Cold War era. Bignell comments that the Hood's Oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with ''James Bond'' villains and fears of China operating as "a 'third force' antagonistic to the West".<ref name="O'Brien, 83"/><ref>Bignell, p.&nbsp;83.</ref> Cull observes that, despite the series' focus on the dangers of nuclear technology, the ''Thunderbird'' machines contradict this particular theme: in their case, "an image of technology associated with the threat of Cold War mass destruction&nbsp;– the rocket emerging from the hidden silo&nbsp;– was appropriated and deployed to ''save'' life rather than to take it."<ref name="Cull: Media, 198"/> He argues that the series adheres more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the "Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown", noting Lady Penelope's role as a spy in addition to two episodes ("[[30 Minutes After Noon]]" and "The Man from MI.5") that are heavily influenced by the ''James Bond'' novels and film adaptations.<ref>Cull 2006 (August), p.&nbsp;199.</ref>

The presentation of smoking in ''Thunderbirds'' was the subject of a study published in the medical journal ''Tobacco Control'' in 2002. Despite identifying examples in 26 episodes, Kate Hunt of the [[University of Glasgow]] concluded that ''Thunderbirds'' does not actively promote smoking&nbsp;– a view opposed by the [[Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation]] (RCLCF) at the time of the series' relaunch on BBC 2.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Hunt, Kate|year=2002|title=Re-Evaluating Smoking and Gender in ''Thunderbirds'' 35 Years On|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=11|issue=2|pages=151–153|location=New York City, New York|publisher=[[BMJ|BMJ Publishing Group]]|format=PDF|issn=1468-3318|oclc=645295997|doi=10.1136/tc.11.2.151|accessdate=15 August 2013|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/2/151.full|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120718234818/http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/2/151.full|archivedate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="BBCSmoking">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1193980.stm|title=Lady Penelope in the Dock|date=28 February 2001|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|location=London, UK|accessdate=7 December 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110517065052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1193980.stm|archivedate=17 May 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> Rejecting the RCLCF's proposal that the remastered episodes be edited to digitally erase all visible cigarettes and cigars, the BBC stated that the series "does not glorify or encourage smoking" and described the activity as "incidental to the plot".<ref name="BBCSmoking"/>

==Later productions==
{{Main|Works based on Thunderbirds}}
''Thunderbirds'' has been followed by two film sequels, a live-action film adaptation, two animated TV remakes and several re-edited presentations for TV broadcast and home video. The second of the remakes, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', premiered on ITV in 2015, the 50th anniversary year of the original.<ref name="TBAG Premiere">{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/thunderbirds-are-go/series-1/episode-1-ring-of-fire-part-1-|title=''Thunderbirds Are Go'' Episode 1: ''Ring of Fire'' (Part 1)|date=4 April 2015|work=[[ITV Player]]|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|location=London, UK|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150817163923/https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/thunderbirds-are-go/series-1/episode-1-ring-of-fire-part-1-|archivedate=17 August 2015|accessdate=17 August 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Film===
The feature-length film sequels ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'' were released in 1966 and 1968. The first was [[greenlit]] by Lew Grade before the TV series had started its broadcast run.<ref>Archer and Nicholls, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> Written and produced by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, both films were distributed by [[United Artists]]. Neither was a critical or commercial success, and [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Cinema]]'s plans for further sequels were abandoned.<ref>Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;41.</ref><ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;159.</ref>

In the early 1980s, episodes of ''Thunderbirds'' and other Supermarionation series were re-edited by ITC's New York offices to create a series of [[compilation film]]s.<ref name="Bentley, 117">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;117.</ref> Branded "Super Space Theater", this format was mostly intended for family viewing on American cable and [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] TV.<ref name="Bentley, 117"/> Three ''Thunderbirds'' features were produced: ''Thunderbirds to the Rescue'', ''Thunderbirds In Outer Space'' and ''Countdown to Disaster''.<ref>Bentley 2008, pp.&nbsp;361–362.</ref>

Plans for a live-action film adaptation were first announced in 1993.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 115">Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;115.</ref><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> These eventually culminated in the 2004 film ''[[Thunderbirds (film)|Thunderbirds]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Frakes]] and produced by [[StudioCanal]] and [[Working Title Films]]. It was a critical and commercial failure and was poorly received by fans of the TV series.<ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;163.</ref>

===TV===
The Andersons sold their intellectual and [[Residual (entertainment industry)|profit participation]] rights to ''Thunderbirds'' and their other productions in the 1970s.<ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;111.</ref><ref>Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;222.</ref> As a result, they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works.<ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/><ref>Anderson 2007, p.&nbsp;88.</ref> ''Thunderbirds'' was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as ''[[Thunderbirds 2086]]''.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 117">Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;117.</ref><ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/> In this [[anime]] re-imagining, set 20 years after the original, the vastly expanded IR is based within an [[arcology]] and operates 17 ''Thunderbird'' machines.<ref name="Bentley, 118">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;118.</ref> It was inspired by ''Thunderhawks'', an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served as the basis for Anderson's [[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]] series ''[[Terrahawks]]''.<ref>Bentley 2008, pp.&nbsp;227 and 363.</ref><ref>Marriott 1993, p.&nbsp;188.</ref>

Two re-edited series, based on condensed versions of 13 of the original episodes, aired in the US in 1994.<ref name="Bentley: EG, 115"/> The first, ''Thunderbirds USA'', was broadcast as part of the [[Fox Kids]] programming block; the second, ''Turbocharged Thunderbirds'', was syndicated by [[UPN]].<ref>Bentley 2005, pp.&nbsp;121–122.</ref> Developed as a comedy, ''Turbocharged Thunderbirds'' moved the action to the planet "Thunder-World" and combined the original puppet footage with new live-action scenes featuring a pair of human teenagers.<ref name="Bentley, 122">Bentley 2005, p.&nbsp;122.</ref><ref>Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;116.</ref>

As well as ''Thunderhawks'', Anderson developed other ideas for a remake. A 1976 concept, ''Inter-Galactic Rescue 4'', was to have featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it.<ref name="Bentley, 117"/><ref>Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;336.</ref> This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, ''T-Force'', which at first could not be pursued owing to a lack of funding.<ref>Bentley 2008, p.&nbsp;325.</ref> Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled ''GFI'', using [[cel animation]]. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.<ref>Bentley 2008, pp.&nbsp;319–320.</ref>

In July 2015, to celebrate the series' 50th anniversary, ''[[Filmed in Supermarionation]]'' documentary director Stephen La Rivière launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to raise the funds necessary to produce three new puppet episodes based on the ''Thunderbirds'' [[mini-album]]s of the 1960s.
